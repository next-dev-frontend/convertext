                    <p>
                      Life insurance is a contract between an individual and an insurance company. It offers a lump-sum payment, known as the death benefit, to the beneficiaries listed in the policy upon the insured person's death. The primary purpose of life insurance is to replace the financial loss that may occur due to the premature death of the policyholder.
